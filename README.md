## Structure

The analysis code has been split based on the measurement modality as below:

- Magnetoencephalography (meeg)
- Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fmri)
- Intracranial Electroencephalography (ieeg)

The analyses for each modality have been carried out independently. Please read the about.md file carefully before using the code.
