## Structure

The analysis code has been split based on the measurement modality as below:

- behavioural and eye tracking (beh_et)
- Magnetoencephalography (meeg)
- Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fmri)
- Intracranial Electroencephalography (ieeg)

The analyses for each modality have been carried out independently. Please read the about.md file carefully before using the code.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/Cogitate-consortium/cogitate-msp1`
2. For each analysis, read the about.md and readme.md files carefully. This will describe how to build the environment and run the code.
